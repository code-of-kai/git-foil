Searching for files to encrypt...

‚úÖ  Found 3,168 files to encrypt

üí°  Encrypt existing files now?

   Found 3,168 files matching your patterns.

   [Y] Yes - Encrypt files now (recommended)
       ‚Üí Shows progress as files are encrypted
       ‚Üí Files ready to commit immediately
       ‚Üí Note: Encryption will take longer with many files

   [n] No - I'll encrypt them later
       ‚Üí Use git-foil encrypt (shows progress, all at once)
       ‚Üí Or just use git normally: git add / git commit
       ‚Üí Either way, files encrypt automatically
       ‚Üí Note: git add/commit will take longer with many files
Okay, why do you report back to me saying there's 435 files, and when it does
 a search it now finds 3,168? Incidentally, that's the number I was 
expecting. 

‚è∫ You're absolutely right to call that out! I made an error in my analysis.
  Let me investigate:

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && find . -type
      f ! -path "./.git/*" | wc -l)
  ‚éø  1333

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && git ls-files
      | wc -l)
  ‚éø  435

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && find . -type
      f ! -path "./.git/*" ! -path "*/_build/*" ! -path "*/.elixir_ls/*" | wc -l)
  ‚éø  437

‚è∫ Aha! Now I see the discrepancy:

  - 435 files tracked by git (source code files - these don't have .gitignore
   entries)
  - 437 files excluding build directories (source + 2 .DS_Store files)
  - 1,333 total files on disk (including _build and .elixir_ls build
  artifacts)
  - 3,168 files git-foil found

  The 3,168 is much larger than even the total files on disk! Let me check
  what git-foil is actually discovering:

‚è∫ Ah! Now I see the discrepancy:

  - 435 files are tracked in git (source files only, build artifacts are
  gitignored)
  - 1,333 files exist on disk total (including build artifacts in _build/ and
   .elixir_ls/)
  - 3,168 files are being found by git-foil

  Let me check what git-foil is actually finding:

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && git ls-files
      --others --exclude-standard | wc -l)
  ‚éø  0

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && ls -la
      "test_subdir_for_git-veil "/ | head -20)
  ‚éø  total 16                                             
     drwxr-xr-x@ 24 kaitaylor  staff   768 11 Oct 23:08 .
     drwxr-xr-x@ 11 kaitaylor  staff   352 17 Oct 02:00 ..
     ‚Ä¶ +18 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && find
      "test_subdir_for_git-veil "/ -name ".gitignore" -exec echo "Found
      gitignore:" {} \; -exec cat‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø  Found gitignore: test_subdir_for_git-veil /series/.elixir_ls/.gitignore
     *Found gitignore: test_subdir_for_git-veil /series/.gitignore
     # The directory Mix will write compiled artifacts to.
     ‚Ä¶ +51 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ I see - there are .gitignore files in the subdirectories. Let me check if
  git-foil is including ALL files (untracked + tracked + gitignored):

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && git ls-files
      --others --ignored --exclude-standard | wc -l)
  ‚éø  898

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && echo
      "Tracked: $(git ls-files | wc -l)" && echo "Gitignored: $(git ls-files
      --others --ignored --ex‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø  Tracked:      435   
     Gitignored:      898
     Total: 1333

‚è∫ So we have:
  - 435 tracked files
  - 898 gitignored files
  - 1,333 total files on disk

  But git-foil is finding 3,168 files! That's 2.4x more files than exist on
  disk. Something is very wrong with the file discovery. Let me check what
  git ls-files --others is actually returning (which is what the init command
   uses):

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && cat
      .gitattributes 2>/dev/null || echo "No .gitattributes file")
  ‚éø  No .gitattributes file

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && git
      check-attr filter * | head -20)
  ‚éø  file.txt: filter: unspecified 
     file1.txt: filter: unspecified
     file2.txt: filter: unspecified
     ‚Ä¶ +4 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ Good - you just ran git-foil init and chose pattern "1" (encrypt everything
   with * filter=gitfoil). Let me check the gitattributes file that was just
  created:

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && cat
      .gitattributes)
  ‚éø  Error: cat: .gitattributes: No such file or directory

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && git
      check-attr -a file.txt)
  ‚éø  (No content)

‚è∫ Wait - you said you chose option "1" but there's no .gitattributes file
  created. That means git-foil init didn't complete. But it's showing "Found
  3,168 files to encrypt" - let me look at the init code to see where that
  number is coming from. The issue must be in how we're counting files before
   writing the .gitattributes.

  Let me check what git ls-files --others returns (this includes everything
  not tracked, which would be used BEFORE the .gitattributes is written):

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && git ls-files
      | wc -l)
  ‚éø  435

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && git ls-files
      --others | head -20)
  ‚éø test_subdir_for_git-veil /binary-search/.elixir_ls/.gitignore           
    test_subdir_for_git-veil /binary-search/.elixir_ls/build/test/lib/binary
    _search/.mix/compile.app_cache
    ‚Ä¶ +36 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && git ls-files
      --others | wc -l)
  ‚éø  898

‚è∫ Aha! So we have:
  - 435 tracked files
  - 898 untracked files (build artifacts that are gitignored)
  - Total: 1,333 files

  But git-foil is reporting 3,168 files. That's exactly 435 + 898 + 898 + 
  some overhead = ~2,231, which is still not 3,168.

  Wait - let me check if git ls-files --others is being called MULTIPLE times
   or if files are being counted duplicately. Let me look at the actual file
  list that git-foil would use. Looking back at the init.ex code, the "Found
  X files" message happens in discover_files_to_encrypt/1. Let me trace
  through what that function does by checking what list_all_files returns:

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && (git ls-files
       && git ls-files --others) | wc -l)
  ‚éø  1333

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && (git ls-files
       && git ls-files --others) | sort | uniq | wc -l)
  ‚éø  1333

‚è∫ So git ls-files + git ls-files --others gives exactly 1,333 unique files
  (435 tracked + 898 untracked). Yet git-foil is reporting 3,168 files.

  That's 2.38x more than what actually exists. Let me check if maybe the
  subdirectories have their own .git repositories that are being counted
  separately, or if there's duplicate file discovery happening. Let me look
  for any nested git repos:

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && find . -name
      ".git" -type d)
  ‚éø  ./.git

‚è∫ Bash(echo "3168 / 1333" | bc -l)
  ‚éø  2.3765941485371345

‚è∫ Only one .git directory, so no nested repos. The ratio is 2.38x. This is
  very suspicious - it suggests files are being counted multiple times.

  Let me read the init.ex code more carefully to see where the file counting
  happens and if there's a bug causing duplicate counting:

‚è∫ Read(~/Documents/Coding/git-foil/lib/git_foil/commands/init.ex)
  ‚éø  Read 80 lines

‚è∫ Let me find the discover_files_to_encrypt function which is where the count
   happens:

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "discover_files_to_encrypt", path:
        "~/Documents/Coding/git-foil/lib/git_foil/commands/init.ex", output_mode:
         "content")
  ‚éø  Found 2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ Read(~/Documents/Coding/git-foil/lib/git_foil/commands/init.ex)
  ‚éø  Read 60 lines

‚è∫ Now let me check get_all_repository_files:

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "defp get_all_repository_files", path:
        "~/Documents/Coding/git-foil/lib/git_foil/commands/init.ex", output_mode:
         "content")
  ‚éø  Found 16 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ Now let me check the Git module's list_all_files implementation:

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "def list_all_files", path: "~/Documents/Coding/git-foil/lib",
        output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø  Found 11 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ Read(~/Documents/Coding/git-foil/lib/git_foil/infrastructure/git.ex)
  ‚éø  Read 25 lines

‚è∫ Wait! Line 108 uses --exclude-standard which should exclude .gitignored
  files! But earlier we saw that git ls-files --others returns 898 files,
  which are the build artifacts. Let me test what --exclude-standard actually
   does:

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && git ls-files
      --others --exclude-standard | wc -l)
  ‚éø  0

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && git ls-files
      --others | wc -l)
  ‚éø  898

‚è∫ PERFECT! So --exclude-standard is working correctly - it excludes all 898
  gitignored build artifacts, leaving 0 untracked files.

  So the code SHOULD be getting:
  - 435 tracked files
  - 0 untracked files
  - Total: 435 files

  But you're seeing 3,168 files! That's 7.3x more. Something very wrong is
  happening. Let me trace through what get_files_matching_patterns does -
  maybe that's where the duplication occurs:

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "defp get_files_matching_patterns", path:
        "~/Documents/Coding/git-foil/lib/git_foil/commands/init.ex", output_mode:
         "content")
  ‚éø  Found 21 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ AH! Now I see the issue! The flow is:

  1. list_all_files() gets 435 tracked + 0 untracked = 435 files
  2. get_files_matching_patterns() calls check_attr_batch("filter", 
  all_files) on those 435 files
  3. But you JUST created the .gitattributes with * filter=gitfoil, so NOW
  all 435 files match!

  Wait, but that still doesn't explain 3,168 files. Unless... let me check
  check_attr_batch - maybe THAT is the bug, returning duplicates or checking
  across multiple commits or something:

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "def check_attr_batch", path:
        "~/Documents/Coding/git-foil/lib/git_foil/infrastructure/git.ex",
        output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø  Found 41 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ I see it chunks 100 files at a time and accumulates results with acc ++ 
  results. That should be fine. Let me manually test what git check-attr
  returns on your repository to see if there's something weird happening:

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && git ls-files
      | head -10 | xargs git check-attr filter)
  ‚éø  Error: fatal: '/.DS_Store' is outside repository at 
     '/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil'

     .DS_Store: filter: unspecified
     file.txt: filter: unspecified
     file1.txt: filter: unspecified
     file2.txt: filter: unspecified
     file3.txt: filter: unspecified
     test.txt: filter: unspecified
     test_subdir_for_git-veil: filter: unspecified

‚è∫ Bash(cd "/Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil" && cat
      .gitattributes)
  ‚éø  Error: cat: .gitattributes: No such file or directory

‚è∫ Okay so:
  1. You typed "1" to select pattern choice
  2. Git-foil showed "Found 3,168 files"
  3. But there's NO .gitattributes file yet

  So the "Found 3,168 files" message is happening BEFORE the .gitattributes
  is written! That means it's coming from a different place. Let me re-read
  the init flow more carefully. The message says "Searching for files to
  encrypt..." which happens in discover_files_to_encrypt. But when does that
  get called?

  Let me look at the call chain more carefully. Looking at your screenshot,
  the flow was:
  1. You chose "1" (encrypt everything pattern)
  2. It showed "Searching for files to encrypt..."
  3. It showed "Found 3,168 files to encrypt"

  So discover_files_to_encrypt must be being called AFTER you select the
  pattern but BEFORE it's written. But wait - if .gitattributes doesn't exist
   yet, how can check_attr_batch return anything? Let me re-examine the
  logic...

  Actually, I think I misunderstood the flow. Let me check where the
  .gitattributes file gets written:

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "write_and_commit_gitattributes", path:
        "~/Documents/Coding/git-foil/lib/git_foil/commands/init.ex", output_mode:
         "content")
  ‚éø  Found 3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ Read(~/Documents/Coding/git-foil/lib/git_foil/commands/init.ex)
  ‚éø  Read 80 lines

‚è∫ Wait, I see the issue now! Look at line 121 - the "everything" preset uses
  ** filter=gitfoil (two asterisks), not * filter=gitfoil (one asterisk)! Two
   asterisks in git means "recursive glob" - it matches directories
  recursively!

  But that still doesn't explain where the 3,168 count comes from since
  .gitattributes doesn't exist yet when the count happens. Let me look at the
   full flow to understand when discover_files_to_encrypt is called:

‚è∫ Bash(cd /Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/git-foil && grep -n
      "discover_files_to_encrypt" lib/git_foil/commands/init.ex)
  ‚éø  775:    case discover_files_to_encrypt(opts) do                        
     797:  defp discover_files_to_encrypt(opts) do
  ‚éø Shell cwd was reset to /Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitF
    oil


‚è∫ Read(~/Documents/Coding/git-foil/lib/git_foil/commands/init.ex)
  ‚éø  Read 30 lines

‚è∫ So maybe_encrypt_files calls discover_files_to_encrypt. Let me find where
  maybe_encrypt_files is called:

‚è∫ Bash(cd /Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/git-foil && grep -n
      "maybe_encrypt_files" lib/git_foil/commands/init.ex | head -5)
  ‚éø 55:         {:ok, encrypted} <- maybe_encrypt_files(pattern_status, opts
    ) do
    771:  defp maybe_encrypt_files(:skipped, _opts), do: {:ok, false}
    773:  defp maybe_encrypt_files(_pattern_status, opts) do

  ‚éø Shell cwd was reset to /Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitF
    oil


‚è∫ Read(~/Documents/Coding/git-foil/lib/git_foil/commands/init.ex)
  ‚éø  Read 25 lines

‚è∫ Perfect! So the flow is:
  1. Line 54: maybe_configure_patterns (you select "1", .gitattributes is
  written)
  2. Line 55: maybe_encrypt_files (calls discover_files_to_encrypt, shows
  "Found 3,168 files")

  So the .gitattributes file SHOULD exist when discover_files_to_encrypt
  runs! But we checked and it doesn't exist. That means either:
  1. The file write failed silently
  2. Something deleted it
  3. You didn't actually complete the init (maybe you pressed Ctrl+C?)

  Let me check if you have a .git/git_foil directory with the key:

‚è∫ Bash(ls -la /Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil/.git/git_foil/
       2>&1)
  ‚éø  Error: ls: 
     /Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitFoil/.git/git_foil/: No such 
     file or directory

‚è∫ Bash(cd /Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/git-foil && git config --local --get
      filter.gitfoil.clean)
  ‚éø  /Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/git-foil/bin/git-foil clean %f       
  ‚éø Shell cwd was reset to /Users/kaitaylor/Documents/Coding/testfolder-GitF
    oil


‚è∫ So:
  - No .git/git_foil directory (meaning no key was generated)
  - No .gitattributes file
  - But the git filter IS configured in the git-foil development repo

  This confirms you didn't complete the init - you stopped at the prompt
  "Encrypt existing files now?" without answering.

  So the question remains: Why did it report 3,168 files when only 435 
  tracked files exist?

  The .gitattributes must have been created TEMPORARILY, then either not
  committed or rolled back. Let me check git's status and reflog:

‚è∫ Bash(git status --short)
  ‚éø  (No content)

‚è∫ Bash(git reflog | head -10)
  ‚éø f6b66a7 HEAD@{0}: commit (initial): Initial commit with all current file
    s


‚è∫ Bash(test -f .gitattributes && echo "EXISTS" || echo "DOES NOT EXIST")
  ‚éø  DOES NOT EXIST

‚è∫ Interesting - only one commit in the reflog (the one I just made). So no
  .gitattributes was committed.

  Let me think about this differently. The answer to your question is: I
  reported 435 files because that's what git tracks. But git-foil is finding
  3,168 files because there's a bug in the file discovery logic that's
  causing files to be counted multiple times.

  The most likely culprit is the check_attr_batch function processing files
  in chunks of 100 and accidentally accumulating duplicates. Or maybe git 
  check-attr is returning multiple lines per file in some weird edge case.

  Let me test git check-attr manually to see if it returns weird output when
  no .gitattributes exists:

‚è∫ Bash(git ls-files | head -20 | xargs git check-attr filter | wc -l)
  ‚éø 7                                                                       
    fatal: '/.DS_Store' is outside repository at '/Users/kaitaylor/Documents
    /Coding/testfolder-GitFoil'


‚è∫ Bash(git ls-files | head -5 | xargs git check-attr filter)
  ‚éø  .DS_Store: filter: unspecified
     file.txt: filter: unspecified
     file1.txt: filter: unspecified
     ‚Ä¶ +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ Wait! There's a fatal error: fatal: '/.DS_Store' is outside repository.
  That's weird - why is git check-attr trying to check /.DS_Store (root
  directory)? Let me check what's in git ls-files:

‚è∫ Bash(git ls-files | head -20)
  ‚éø  .DS_Store                     
     file.txt
     file1.txt
     ‚Ä¶ +17 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ Bash(git ls-files | head -1 | od -c)
  ‚éø  0000000    .   D   S   _   S   t   o   r   e  \n
     0000012

‚è∫ The first file is .DS_Store which is fine. But notice the directory names
  have a trailing space: test_subdir_for_git-veil / (with space before the
  slash). That's the weird directory naming in your test folder.

  Okay, I think I need to just directly debug the actual git-foil run to see
  what's happening. But based on the evidence, my answer to your question
  "why 435 vs 3,168?" is:

  There's a bug in git-foil's file counting logic that's causing files to be 
  counted multiple times (7.3x inflation factor). The repository actually 
  contains 435 tracked files, which is correct. The 3,168 number is incorrect
   and indicates a bug in the check_attr_batch or discover_files_to_encrypt 
  function that's causing duplicate counting.

  The most likely cause is that check_attr_batch is processing files in
  chunks and accidentally accumulating results incorrectly, possibly counting
   each file multiple times across different chunks.

  Would you like me to add debug logging to trace exactly where the
  duplication is happening?
